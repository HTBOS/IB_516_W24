# IB_516_W24
### This Repo is for the project portion of IB516 taken during Winter 2024
[This is a link to this repo](https://github.com/HTBOS/IB_516_W24)

## Objectives of this project
1. Script the upload of relatively large image files such as .lif files to an accesible repository (Box will be the repository for this project)
    * Note1: This step is not always neccisary if image hosting and image processing will take place on the same machine
2. Scipt the calling of 1 or more image files from Box (or other data repository) to a local machine or whever image processing will take place
    * See Note1
3. Automate image processing in Fiji with 1 or more Macros (.ijm)
    * Note2: .ijm Macros must be installed in the copy of Fiji/ImageJ being used for image processing
4. Script the automatic uploading of comma-seperated-value files to an accesible repository
    * Similiar to Note1
5. Automate calling and editing/concatenating of .csv files 
    * Similiar to Note1
6. Automate statistical processing of measurements within R/RStudio
    * Note3: This may be delayed until a better R-package is designed / intergratable for this purpose
